    You can use Spotify's Web API to discover music and podcasts, manage your Spotify library, control audio playback, and much more. Browse our available Web API endpoints using the sidebar at left, or via the navigation bar on top of this page on smaller screens.

    In order to make successful Web API requests your app will need a valid access token. One can be obtained through <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/">OAuth 2.0</a>.

    The base URI for all Web API requests is `https://api.spotify.com/v1`.

    Need help? See our <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/guides/">Web API guides</a> for more information, or visit the <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Spotify-for-Developers/bd-p/Spotify_Developer">Spotify for Developers community forum</a> to ask questions and connect with other developers.

            Your search query.

            You can narrow down your search using field filters. The available filters are `album`, `artist`, `track`, `year`, `upc`, `tag:hipster`, `tag:new`, `isrc`, and `genre`. Each field filter only applies to certain result types.

            The `artist` and `year` filters can be used while searching albums, artists and tracks. You can filter on a single `year` or a range (e.g. 1955-1960).<br />
            The `album` filter can be used while searching albums and tracks.<br />
            The `genre` filter can be used while searching artists and tracks.<br />
            The `isrc` and `track` filters can be used while searching tracks.<br />
            The `upc`, `tag:new` and `tag:hipster` filters can only be used while searching albums. The `tag:new` filter will return albums released in the past two weeks and `tag:hipster` can be used to return only albums with the lowest 10% popularity.<br />

        pitches:
          description: |
            Pitch content is given by a “chroma” vector, corresponding to the 12 pitch classes C, C#, D to B, with values ranging from 0 to 1 that describe the relative dominance of every pitch in the chromatic scale. For example a C Major chord would likely be represented by large values of C, E and G (i.e. classes 0, 4, and 7).

            Vectors are normalized to 1 by their strongest dimension, therefore noisy sounds are likely represented by values that are all close to 1, while pure tones are described by one value at 1 (the pitch) and others near 0.
            As can be seen below, the 12 vector indices are a combination of low-power spectrum values at their respective pitch frequencies.
            <img src="https://developer.spotify.com/assets/audio/Pitch_vector.png" />
          example:
          - 0.212
          - 0.141
          - 0.294

        timbre:
          description: |
            Timbre is the quality of a musical note or sound that distinguishes different types of musical instruments, or voices. It is a complex notion also referred to as sound color, texture, or tone quality, and is derived from the shape of a segment’s spectro-temporal surface, independently of pitch and loudness. The timbre feature is a vector that includes 12 unbounded values roughly centered around 0. Those values are high level abstractions of the spectral surface, ordered by degree of importance.

            For completeness however, the first dimension represents the average loudness of the segment; second emphasizes brightness; third is more closely correlated to the flatness of a sound; fourth to sounds with a stronger attack; etc. See an image below representing the 12 basis functions (i.e. template segments).
            <img src="https://developer.spotify.com/assets/audio/Timbre_basis_functions.png" />

            The actual timbre of the segment is best described as a linear combination of these 12 basis functions weighted by the coefficient values: timbre = c1 x b1 + c2 x b2 + ... + c12 x b12, where c1 to c12 represent the 12 coefficients and b1 to b12 the 12 basis functions as displayed below. Timbre vectors are best used in comparison with each other.
          example:
          - 42.115
          - 64.373

            Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.

Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.

        energy:
          description: |
            Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.

        instrumentalness:
          description: |
            Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.

        key:
          description: |
            The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard [Pitch Class notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class). E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.
          example: 9
          maximum: 11
          minimum: -1
          type: integer
        liveness:
          description: |
            Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.

        loudness:
          description: |
            The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.
          example: -5.883

        mode:
          description: |
            Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.
          example: 0
          type: integer
        popularity:
          description: |
            The popularity of the track. The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are. _**Note**: When applying track relinking via the `market` parameter, it is expected to find relinked tracks with popularities that do not match `min_*`, `max_*`and `target_*` popularities. These relinked tracks are accurate replacements for unplayable tracks with the expected popularity scores. Original, non-relinked tracks are available via the `linked_from` attribute of the [relinked track response](/documentation/general/guides/track-relinking-guide)._

        speechiness:
          description: |
            Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.

The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.<br>Generally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past. Duplicate tracks (e.g. the same track from a single and an album) are rated independently. Artist and album popularity is derived mathematically from track popularity. _**Note**: the popularity value may lag actual popularity by a few days: the value is not updated in real time._
